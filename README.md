# Balance

Introduction: 
Balance is the culmination of my time studying at Enspiral's Dev Academy. In the final week of study my team came together around the idea of creating a budgeting app. 

The brief was to create an accessible application that was able to be used immediately. We wanted to add mobile compatibility, and have budgeting information displayed visually for the user. As a stretch we would look into having the ability to login and logout so that our clients could save their budgets and we could send monthly updates through to them (if they so desired).

Initially I found myself sparking up the discussions around how we would visualise the data and how we would ensure our code was accessible to all audiences. From there I set up our CI / CD systems, and lead the testing of the application. We managed to write over 50 tests for this project both with jest, unit testing, and cypress for end-to-end tests. 

Creating Balance was a huge challenge but one that I thoroughly enjoyed.


Quick Overview:
To fire up the app as soon as possible you will need to:

* git clone 
* npm i (just to be safe)
* npm start

open http://localhost:3000/ to see the Balance app
